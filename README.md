This repository demonstrates a common yet easily overlooked issue in HTML DOM manipulation involving the `textContent` property.  The `bug.html` file shows the incorrect use of `textContent`, resulting in incomplete text extraction. The `bugSolution.html` provides a corrected approach using a recursive function or a different DOM traversal method. This is a great example for those new to frontend development to understand how different methods work on HTML elements.
